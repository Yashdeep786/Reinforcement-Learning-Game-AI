ðŸ§  Signal: The Emergent Language Game
Signal is an interactive reinforcement learning (RL) game where humans and an AI agent try to develop a shared language using just colored emoji signals. Inspired by emergent communication studies in AI, the game challenges the AI to learn your patternsâ€”and for you to test how well it understands them.

ðŸŽ® How It Works
You send a signal using a combination of emojis (e.g., ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´).

The AI agent replies with its own emoji pattern, trying to interpret or respond meaningfully.

You provide feedback by selecting whether the AI "understood" your signal (yes or no).

If the feedback is positive, the AI learns to associate your signal with its response using a simple reward-based memory.

Over time, a shared symbolic language may emerge.

ðŸ’¡ Purpose
This game serves as a minimalist platform to explore:

Basic reinforcement learning loops

Human-AI communication

Pattern recognition and abstraction

Memory-based learning without supervision

âœ¨ Features
Emoji-based symbolic communication

Simple RL memory (positive feedback reinforcement)

Stateless input with stateful learning

Feedback loop for incremental learning
